# WealthPark
Test task done for "Wealth Park"

For DI used Dagger2
For API interaction used Retrofit+okHttp
For architecture used: mvvm
For loading animation used lottie
For view data updates used livedata+view binding (for me it is most convenient choice, but i can do anything else here)
For navigation used android navigation component.
App bar navigation made also through nav component
Basic animations made through nav component
For gathering server data used RxAndroid (as far as it is more popular than kotlin flow it maybe will fit you more)
Design is quite close to reference, but not 1:1 as far as i prefer titles bigger.
Colors are not adjusted fully, but dark mode supported. Color changing doesnt show actual skills :)
For some reusable components - styling used.

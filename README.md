# WealthPark
Test task done for "Wealth Park"

1. For DI used Dagger2
2. For API interaction used Retrofit+okHttp
3. For architecture used: mvvm
4. For loading animation used lottie
5. For view data updates used livedata+view binding (for me it is most convenient choice, but i can do anything else here)
6. For navigation used android navigation component.
7. App bar navigation made also through nav component
8. Basic animations made through nav component
9. For gathering server data used RxAndroid (as far as it is more popular than kotlin flow it maybe will fit you more)
10. Design is quite close to reference, but not 1:1 as far as i prefer titles bigger.
11. Colors are not adjusted fully, but dark mode supported. Color changing doesnt show actual skills :)
12. For some reusable components - styling used.
